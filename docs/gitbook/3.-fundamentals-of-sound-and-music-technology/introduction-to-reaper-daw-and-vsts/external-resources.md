# External Resources

A comprehensive list of practice-based videos regarding Reaper can be found on the product website: https://www.reaper.fm/videos.php

Other tutorial resources can be found on YouTube, the key thing is to know the terms for the effects you want to achieve. So consulting some textbooks on audio and music production can help. [See this linked review of books regarding music production in 2023 for examples](https://blog.landr.com/music-production-books/) (the David Byrne one is really good!). If you are more into sound design check out these books available through the [RCA Library](https://library.rca.ac.uk/client/en\_GB/summon/?)
