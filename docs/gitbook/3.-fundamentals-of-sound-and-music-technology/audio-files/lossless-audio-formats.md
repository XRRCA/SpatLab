## Lossless Audio Formats

When recording and mixing, having the highest quality possible is ideal. With lossless file types all the sound information is preserved and stored. Lossless files give the highest quality possible, but they eat up your storage as you work.

_Examples of lossless file types: FLAC, ALAC, AIFF, WAV_
