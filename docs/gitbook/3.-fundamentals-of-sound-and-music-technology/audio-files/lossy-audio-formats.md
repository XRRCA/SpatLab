## Lossy Audio Formats

With lossy files some of the audio data is discarded as the original recording is compressed. Lossy formats often get used by streaming services like Spotify, and they are the preferred format on iTunes. Their small file sizes make them easy to download or stream.

_Examples of lossy file types: AAC, MP3, OGG, WMA_
