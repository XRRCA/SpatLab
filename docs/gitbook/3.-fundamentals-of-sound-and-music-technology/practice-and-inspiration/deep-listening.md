## Deep Listening

_"Listening is directing attention to what is heard, gathering meaning, interpreting and deciding on action." (Pauline Oliveros)_

Deep listening is practicing listening with the understanding that complex waveforms are continuously transmitted to the auditory and haptic cortex from the outside world, by the body and the ear, that require active engagement with attention. Listening takes place voluntarily, but listening is not the same as hearing and hearing is not the same as listening. The ear is constantly gathering and transmitting information—however, attention can tune out stimuli.

Deep has to do with complexity and boundaries, or edges beyond ordinary or habitual understandings—i.e. “the subject is too deep for me” or “she is a deep one”. A subject that is “too deep” surpasses one’s present understanding or has too many unknown parts to grasp easily. A “deep one” defies stereotypical knowing and may take either a long time or never to understand or get to know. 

Deep coupled with Listening or Deep Listening is learning to expand the perception of sounds to include the whole space/time continuum of sound — encountering the vastness and complexities as much as possible. Simultaneously one ought to be able to target a sound or sequence of sounds as a focus within the space/time continuum and to perceive the detail or trajectory of the sound or sequence of sounds. Such a focus should always return to or be within the whole of the space/time continuum (context). Such expansion means that one is connected to the whole of the environment and beyond.
