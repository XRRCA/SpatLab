## Field Recording

Field recording is the practice of capturing sounds and audio in their natural environment, usually with a portable recording device or microphone. The purpose of field recording is to capture the sounds of a particular location or environment, and to preserve them for future use in various contexts, such as music production, sound design, film, and video game production.

Field recording can involve capturing a wide range of sounds, from natural sounds like birdsongs, rain, or wind, to man-made sounds like traffic, machinery, or public spaces. Field recording can also involve capturing the sounds of people, conversations, and cultural events, such as festivals or ceremonies.

Field recording is often used by musicians, sound designers, and film and video game producers as a way to create immersive and realistic soundscapes that can enhance the overall experience of the audience. It allows for the creation of unique and authentic sounds that cannot be replicated in a studio environment, and provides a rich source of inspiration for creative work.
