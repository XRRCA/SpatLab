## Background and History
Several different 'streams' or 'schools' are the antecedents of today's technologically-mediated music and sonic arts:

* Futurists c.1900s-1930s (Italy, Russia) - music and musical life to imitate/celebrate new technology.
* John Cage and Conceptualism c.1940s-1970s (USA) - liberation of noise and introduction of 'non-musical structures' into music.
* Musique Concr√®te c.1940/50s (France)- liberation of noise/everyday sounds helping to provide an alternative to Western Classical music's 'abstract music' project.
* Elektronische Musik c.1940/50s (Germany) - analogue technology for extension of Western Classical music's 'abstract  music' project, features include:
   * synthesis and.parametric control over tonal materials
* Computer music late 1950s (USA) - digital technology for extension of Western Classical music's 'abstract music' project, features include:
   * synthesis and enhanced parametric control over tonal materials
   * integrating compositional and textural control (e.g. algorithmic composition)
* Anything missing? [Brazilian modernists](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/making-it-heard-9781501344435/), soundscape movement, dub, radiophonic workshop...


To give you some form of general definition, Electroacoustic music and sonic arts are a contemporary approach to composition. In its current form, the field owes much to the sonic  and conceptual explorations of John Cage, where artists investigation of sound goes beyond standard musical structures, incorporating broader ranges of environmentally-derived (and culturally-derived)  sound materials and experiences through technology. Defining characteristics are the use of exploratory sound processing (timbre  is the key structural domain of this music), sound synthesis, the presentation of 'fixed media' works in 'tape music' concerts, or, presentation over multiple loudspeakers (spatial arrays or ' loudspeaker orchestras ') where possible. Its materials and means may, however, cross over to other related areas of artistic practice: sound art and sound installations, digital/media  arts, popular electronic musics (EDM, glitch, ambient) and live electronic music performance, and composition for acoustic instruments and electronics.
