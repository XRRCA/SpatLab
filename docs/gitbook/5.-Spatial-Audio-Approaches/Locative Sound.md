# Locative Sound

Locative sound refers to sound art and music that is specifically designed for and responds to a particular physical space or location. It is a form of site-specific audio that uses the unique acoustic properties of a space to create an immersive and interactive sonic experience. 

This can be done with various speakers and sensors scattered around a space which either requires direct input from the audience such as the use of mobile phones to contribute towards a cacophony of noise, or in passive way by tracking how many people are in a room to trigger sound.
