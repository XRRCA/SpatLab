## Sampling

Audio sampling is the process of capturing and recording a brief section of audio from a pre-existing recording, and then reusing it in a new composition or production. The sample can be a drum loop, a guitar riff, a vocal phrase, or any other sound that can be isolated and manipulated.

In audio sampling, the original recording is often manipulated in some way, such as changing its pitch, tempo, or adding effects, to create a new musical composition. Sampling has become an essential part of modern music production, as it allows artists to incorporate pre-existing recordings into their work and create new sounds and compositions that would otherwise be impossible.

Sampling can also raise legal and ethical issues, as it involves the use of copyrighted material without permission. To address these issues, most music producers obtain clearance or licenses from the owners of the original recordings before using samples in their work.

Audio sampling is also used in other applications, such as sound design for film and video games, where pre-existing sounds can be used to create new sound effects and immersive soundscapes.
