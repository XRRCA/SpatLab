# Making weird instruments

_"First, you build the machine, then it tells you what it’s for. A machine is only a kind of magnet for attracting Use. That’s why we say things are Useful - because they are all full of the Use that chose them to perform itself." (Catherynne M. Valente, The Melancholy of Mechagirl, 2013)_

A rock, a can, a bottle, a string. What kind of instruments can be built out of the junk we find around us? How does the human body relate to that instrument? Having become familiar with our instrument we invert, we roam its expressive scope, as if exploring a landscape that is covered by fog, but there within we come upon beautiful local areas that entice and attract. This is about finding the constraints of the instrument, a path to mastery that requires time and effort: a process of discovery, of research.

An imaginary musical instrument made from paper cups, folded cardboard and bits of string.

When thinking about making these objects, think about the processes of the organisation rather than just the making of the object or the musical function. What compositional decisions do you make not related material production?

For some technical examples, [here is a video](https://vimeo.com/386541096?embedded=true\&source=video\_title\&owner=926102) of Garth Paine demonstrating a hybrid digital-analogue musical instrument.
