## What is a VST?
All the essential plugins you need will come in just four general categories:

* **Virtual Instrument Plugins** – also called VSTi, these are plugins that emulate actual musical instruments. They come in a few different types: Samplers, Softsynths, Drum Machines. What these plugins do is emulate the sounds of a real live instrument in your DAW. You can “play” these virtual instruments using a midi controller/instrument, or you can write the notes into your piano roll using your mouse.
* **Effects Plugins** – sometimes referred to as Effects processors. Effects plugins are used to change or adjust the sound of the audio coming in and going out of your DAW. Generally speaking, but not always, effects processors work in the “time domain”, meaning, they alter the way the sound is perceived or produced within time, to produce the desired effect. Common ones include Reverbs and Delays,  Choruses, Flangers and Phasers.
* **Dynamics Plugins** – sometimes referred to as Dynamic processors. Dynamic plugins are dynamic processors that alter the amplitude of the audio signal to provide desired results. This means, the will either boost or cut parts of or whole frequency sections of an audio signal to change the way it sounds, or otherwise change the way the signal’s loudness is perceived. These include Equalizers (or EQ for short), Filters, Compressors and Limiters.

These videos and sound samples give some sonic context of the plugin types described above. Likewise, for VSTs, as individual bits of technology, check reviews on YouTube to understand what different plugins can do.
