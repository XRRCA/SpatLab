## Novel Spaces and their Psychoacoustic Effects

Spaces and spatial arrangements create the container for our sonic experience of the everyday world. The sound of spaces is commonly associated with the term reverberation.

**Reverberation** (_reverb_) is a sound effect that occurs when sound waves bounce off surfaces in an enclosed space, such as a room or a concert hall. The reflections of sound waves from the walls, floor, and ceiling create a series of echoes that blend together to create a characteristic sound unique to the space.

**Reverb** can occur naturally in any enclosed space, but it can also be artificially generated using electronic equipment, such as digital signal processors. Artificial reverb can be used in music production and live sound reinforcement to add depth and dimension to a sound or to create a sense of space or ambiance. Reverb can be adjusted to change its size, shape, and decay time to create different effects and enhance the overall sound of a recording or live performance.
