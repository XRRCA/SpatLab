## Giving yourself compositional challenges i.e. regular practise

[The Disquiet Junto](https://disquiet.com/) series of weekly communal music projects explore constraints as a springboard for creativity and productivity. There is a new project each Thursday afternoon (California time), and it is due the following Monday at 11:59pm 

The junto project list contains a list of possible challenges, that link to practice examples on Soundcloud. You could try out some of these challenges as a group and share your creations. An example:

>0462 / Vade in Pace / The Assignment: Write a short piece of music that gets slower and slower as it proceeds.
