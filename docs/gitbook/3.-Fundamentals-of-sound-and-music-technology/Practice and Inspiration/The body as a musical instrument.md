## The body as a musical instrument
By means of example, I would like to put forward the work of RCA Design Interactions student  Choi Ka Fai, whose project questions embodied knowledge and possibly new expressive meanings of agency, video below. Central to the project is the study of body movement in dance. Using electronic muscle stimulation, you can remotely control anotherâ€™s actions or be controlled by previously recorded muscle memories. While entirely based in the now of technology, this work addresses complex issues of our bodies including memory, synchronicity, expressivity, and agency.
