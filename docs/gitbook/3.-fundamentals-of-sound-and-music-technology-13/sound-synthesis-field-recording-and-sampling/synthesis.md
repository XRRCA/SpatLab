## Synthesis

Sound synthesis is the process of creating sound electronically or digitally, either through hardware or software, using various techniques and algorithms. Sound synthesis involves creating complex waveforms or sound textures that can be manipulated to produce a wide variety of sounds, from simple sine waves to complex timbres that resemble real-world instruments.

There are several techniques used in sound synthesis, including [subtractive synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis), [additive synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis), [frequency modulation synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis), [granular synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis), [wavetable synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavetable_synthesis), and [physical modeling synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis). Each technique involves a different approach to creating and manipulating sound.

These videos outline the concepts above:

Sound synthesis is used extensively in music production, film and video game sound design, and other multimedia applications. It allows sound designers and musicians to create unique and expressive sounds that can be tailored to specific contexts and purposes.

List of some Sound Designers who you could look at:
+ [Brian Eno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwYtllyt3Q) - an English musician and producer who is known for his pioneering work in ambient music, using techniques such as tape looping, sampling, and synthesis.
+ [Richard D. James (Aphex Twin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5AiRVqfqk) - an English electronic musician and producer who is known for his innovative use of synthesis, including the creation of his own custom software instruments.
+ [Holly Herndon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6baj34lxF4g) - an American composer and sound artist who is known for her work with voice processing and synthesis, and for her use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in her music.
+ [Winifred Phillips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKA4bnsTBl0) - an American composer and sound designer who has worked on many popular video game titles such as Assassin's Creed III, God of War, and LittleBigPlanet 2.
