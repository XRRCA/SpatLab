## What is Reaper?

Reaper is a DAW that allows you record and mix audio, like band studio session, or, if you are working alone, playing back previous [recordings](https://www.musicgateway.com/blog/how-to/vocal-recording-101-how-to-record-vocals-for-beginners) while recording new tracks alongside them. The following video gives a comprehensive overview of basic Reaper features and acts as a jump start to using it with your own materials.

I recommend watching this [tutorial series on Reaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0c-_YyuUts&list=PLM0xHqxaiT6-plorG47t3balft4nVki39) by Kenny Gioia.
