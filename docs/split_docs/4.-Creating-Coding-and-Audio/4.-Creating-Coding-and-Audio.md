>We don't cover the basics of programming here in this wiki, but if you want a quick and thorough introduction into programming (specifically C languages) you can check out the [unity-scripting](https://github.com/XRRCA/unity-scripting) repo which has a basic introduction in the _README.md_

Pure Data (Pd) and Max/MSP are both visual programming languages used for creating and manipulating real-time audio and multimedia. They allow you to create interactive, real-time audio and visual performances, as well as interactive installations, multimedia applications, and more.

#### Pure Data
Often abbreviated as Pd, Pure Data is a free and open-source graphical programming language for audio and multimedia. It was created by Miller Puckette in the 1990s as a follow-up to his earlier programming language, Max. Pd is designed to be highly extensible and flexible, and it can be used for a wide range of audio and multimedia applications.

#### Max/MSP
Max/MSP, on the other hand, is a commercial visual programming language for music and multimedia developed by Cycling '74. Max/MSP has been around since the 1980s and has since been used in many different fields, including music, art, performance, and education. Max/MSP is known for its user-friendly interface and powerful tools for working with audio, video, and other multimedia.
There is a cheaper license which is available with an educational email with `.ac.` such as: `blahblah@youruniveristy.ac.uk`.

Both Pure Data and Max/MSP are popular among musicians, artists, and designers for their ability to create custom audio and multimedia applications without requiring extensive programming knowledge.
