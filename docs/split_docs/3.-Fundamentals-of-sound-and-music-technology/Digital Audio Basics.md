# Digital Audio Basics

Sound is a vibration in the air around us that we receive at our ears (and decode in our brains). Digital audio is simply ‘sound (accurately) described by numbers’. Digital audio is simply another means of encoding the air pressure vibration that is sound so that we can transmit or alter it.

This flow diagram shows how analogue signals are digitized to make digital audio signals.

Sampling is the process of changing the continuously varying (analogue) signal into a discrete set of digital readings (number values for specified time intervals). The process in the image above shows an audio signal being sampled at a regular rate: this reads off the size (amplitude) of the air pressure variation for each time interval. We then have numbers that embody a simplified representation of the original audio (depending on how accurate our sampling system is). Accuracy in sampling depends on two things: amplitude resolution (bit depth) and frequency resolution (sample rate). Common numbers for good quality recordings include:

Bit depth: 16, 24, 32

Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 96kHz (kHz = kilo-Hertz, so at 48 kHz a signal is sampled 48000 times per second).
